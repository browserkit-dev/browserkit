# AGENTS.md — Workspace Memory

Durable facts and correction patterns for this workspace. Updated by continual-learning.

## Project: browserkit (name TBD)

- The project name "browserkit" is disliked — user is exploring alternatives (e.g. `ferret`, `harbr`, `portkey`)
- Language is TypeScript, not Python
- MCP transport is HTTP (`StreamableHTTPServerTransport`), not stdio — preferred for multi-agent deployment
- Each adapter gets its own HTTP port; each connecting MCP client gets its own `McpServer + StreamableHTTPServerTransport` pair (per-session factory inside the HTTP handler). Shared state (browser, lock, rate limiter) lives outside the McpServer.
- Adapter packages are plain npm packages with no naming convention — config keys are npm package names, resolved via `require(key)`
- Adapters live in external git repos as standalone packages; the monorepo's `adapter-linkedin` is a reference implementation only
- No abstract base class for adapters — `SiteAdapter` is an interface, shared logic is standalone utility functions (composition over inheritance)
- No Docker — headed browser + human handoff requires native display; Docker needs X11/XQuartz which breaks local-first UX

## Browser Lifecycle

- Default: fully headless — no visible window, no Dock icon
- Headed browser opens only for: `browserkit login <site>` command, watch mode, pause mode
- Login when server not running: same profile dir (captures everything including IndexedDB)
- Login when server is running: temporary headed browser on fresh temp profile, storageState transfer into running headless context (zero downtime)
- Startup warns about unauthenticated adapters and continues (does not block)
- Session expiry mid-use: auto-retry in background — opens temp headed browser, transfers cookies when login detected

## Browser Control

- Browser mode switching (`headless` / `watch` / `paused`), screenshot, page state, and navigate are MCP tools auto-registered on every adapter server — not CLI commands
- Management tools bypass the LockManager; regular automation tools go through it
- "Raw" Playwright access means exposing the CDP WebSocket URL (`wsEndpoint()`) of each adapter's browser — external agents (Claude Code, Cursor) attach to the already-authenticated session and write their own Playwright scripts via shell
- The Playwright skill pattern: AI writes a script to `/tmp`, executes it via shell — no `run(code)` MCP tool needed
- MCP resources use `page://${site}/snapshot` (site name dynamic) — user pushed back when the URI appeared to hardcode the adapter name

## Design Process Preferences

- User pushes back on recommendations blindly following research sources — "do not take anything as granted from the sources, it's a recommendation at best"
- User prefers reasoning through design decisions before implementation (brainstorming phase)
- Vertical slice approach rejected — user prefers abstraction-first (framework is the product, not the first adapter)
- When user provides inline decisions like `option || do this`, implement exactly what is specified
- HackerNews used as the first demo adapter (Shufersal is geo-blocked outside Israel)
- User prefers reviewing plans and code changes before execution starts — ask for review before implementing
- Testing preference: all 4 layers (unit, scraping integration, MCP protocol, reliability) — user said "all of those" without hesitation; don't propose a subset
- Bugs found during testing should be fixed inline ("fix issues on the go"), not deferred to a follow-up task
- Adapter developers should minimize visible dependency on the framework — adapters should feel like standalone npm packages, not framework plugins
